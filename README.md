# Hi, my name is JesÃºs ðŸ‘‹

I am Physicist since 2018 and have been a self-taught programmer since I first discovered the world of technology. I've done multiple projects in different programming languages â€‹â€‹privately. Now that I know Github and its power to reach more people, I decided to start uploading everything I've done in these years publicly. 

##  Programming languages
